# Plant Care App (COMP3000)

### Project Title
Plant Care App using Image Recognition

### Project Vision
For plant owners or anyone with an interest in plants, who want to identify the different species in order to learn how to properly care for them and keep them as healthy as possible. The Plant Care App is an easy-to-use image recognition web application, which will allow users to upload an image of a plant and the plant species will be identified. It will also provide the user with a range of plant care information for their identified plant – for example, the plant type, characteristics, and conditions in which it should be kept. In addition to this, the Plant Care App will allow users to create an account and login to the application, where they will be able to save their identified plants to ‘my garden’. This will allow users to refer back to their previous identification results rather than having to repeat the process each time they want to view the plant information. The Plant Care App will save users’ time spent searching the internet to identify their different plants' species and how to care for them, by providing all of this information in one click.
